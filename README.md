# ERP POC:

## Introduction
This project is intended to showcase an real world application as part of my personal coding portfolio. 

To make things interesting, the API implementations have been created in both Java/Spring and NodeJS (Express,Typescript,TypeORM) stacks. This helps to illustrate a lot of the common design concepts that may be applied to both tech snacks.

## Architecture
The overall application has been decomposed into a series of individual projects. An relational database is used to persist the data, and an messaging bus is utilized in order to facilitate asnych operations where appropriate.
